The installation instructions are

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

You can run tests with
    make test

Note: The current installation only works with certain versions of cmake, e.g.,
      it works with cmake v3.18.0, but it does not work with cmake v3.16.3. We
      have not done a thorough test on this yet. Try to use v3.18.0 if you get
      issues running the installation.
