    '''For "query" sentences, this function gets the mean and variance of
    scores from the best matching words-in-context in a set of provided "key"
    sentences. This matching process matches the word and the words preceding
    it, looking for the highest-order match it can find (it's intended for
    approximating the scores of models that see only left-context,
    like language models). The intended application is in estimating the scores
    of hypothesized transcripts, when we have actually computed the scores for
    only a subset of the hypotheses.

    CAUTION:
      This function only runs on CPU for now.

    Args:
      tokens:
        A ragged tensor of int32_t with 2 or 3 axes. If 2 axes, this represents
        a collection of key and query sequences. If 3 axes, this represents a
        set of such collections.

          2-axis example:
            [ [ the, cat, said, eos ], [ the, cat, fed, eos ] ]
          3-axis example:
            [ [ [ the, cat, said, eos ], [ the, cat, fed, eos ] ],
              [ [ hi, my, name, is, eos ], [ bye, my, name, is, eos ] ], ... ]

        where the words would actually be represented as integers,
        The eos symbol is required if this code is to work as intended
        (otherwise this code will not be able to recognize when we have reached
        the beginnings of sentences when comparing histories).
        bos symbols are allowed but not required.

      scores:
        A one dim torch.tensor with scores.size() == tokens.NumElements(),
        this is the item for which we are requesting best-matching values
        (as means and variances in case there are multiple best matches).
        In our anticipated use, these would represent scores of words in the
        sentences, but they could represent anything.
      counts:
        An one dim torch.tensor with counts.size() == tokens.NumElements(),
        containing 1 for words that are considered "keys" and 0 for
        words that are considered "queries".  Typically some entire
        sentences will be keys and others will be queries.
      eos:
        The value of the eos (end of sentence) symbol; internally, this
        is used as an extra padding value before the first sentence in each
        collection, so that it can act like a "bos" symbol.
      min_token:
        The lowest possible token value, including the bos
        symbol (e.g., might be -1).
      max_token:
        The maximum possible token value.  Be careful not to
        set this too large the implementation contains a part which
        takes time and space O(max_token - min_token).
      max_order:
        The maximum n-gram order to ever return in the
        `ngram_order` output; the output will be the minimum of max_order
        and the actual order matched; or max_order if we matched all the
        way to the beginning of both sentences. The main reason this is
        needed is that we need a finite number to return at the
        beginning of sentences.

    Returns:
      Returns a tuple of four torch.tensor (mean, var, counts_out, ngram_order)
        mean:
          For query positions, will contain the mean of the scores at the
          best matching key positions, or zero if that is undefined because
          there are no key positions at all.  For key positions,
          you can treat the output as being undefined (actually they
          are treated the same as queries, but won't match with only
          themselves because we don't match at singleton intervals).
        var:
          Like `mean`, but contains the (centered) variance
          of the best matching positions.
        counts_out:
          The number of key positions that contributed to the `mean`
          and `var` statistics.  This should only be zero if `counts`
          was all zero.
        ngram_order:
          The n-gram order corresponding to the best matching
          positions found at each query position, up to a maximum of
          `max_order`; will be `max_order` if we matched all
          the way to the beginning of a sentence.
