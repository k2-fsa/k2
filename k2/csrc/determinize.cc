  Conceptually a determinized state in weighted FSA determinization would
  normally
  be a weighted subset of states in the input FSA, with the weights normalized
  somehow (e.g. subtracting the sum of the weights).

  Two determinized states are equal if the states and weights are the same.  To
  ensure differentiability, our assumption is that in general no two arcs in the
  input FSA have identical weights.  We argue that two determinized states can
  always be represented as a base-state and a symbol sequence.  Imagine that we
  follow arcs with that symbol sequence from the base-state, and then in case we
  reach the same states in the different ways we always select the best path
  from the base-state.  That process gives us a set of states and weights.  We
  argue that this representation is unique.  (If not, it won't matter actually;
  it will just give us an output that's less minimal than it could be).

  /*
    Normalizes this DetState and sets forward_backward_weight.

    By 'normalize' what we mean is the following:

       - Remove duplicates.

         If the DLL of DetStateElements contains duplicate elements (i.e.
         elements whose paths end in the same state) it removes whichever has
    the
         smallest weight.  (Remember, a determinized state is, conceptually, a
         weighted subset of elements; we are implementing determinization in a
         tropical-like semiring where we take the best weight.

         In case of ties on the weights, we carefully re-examine the paths to
         make sure that the tie was not due to numerical roundoffi; and if it
         was still a tie, we disambiguate using a lexical order on state
         sequences.  The reason it's important to have deterministic behavior in
         case of ties on weights, is that a failure here could lead to
         situations where we didn't advance the base state where we could,
         leading the number of determinized states to be larger than it could
         be.

       - Advance the base state if possible.  Each DetState can be represented
         as a base state and a sequence of symbols from that base state, but
         if some initial subsequence of that symbol sequence takes us to
         a unique state then we say the DetState is not normalized.  In that
         case we need to advance the base state and reduced `seq_len`.
         If this happens, then the arc sequence which takes us to the new
         base state will be output to `leftover_arcs`.  When this is done,
         the 'weight' components of the DetStateElement members also need
         to be adjusted to remove the weight contribution from those arcs.

     The forward_backward_weight is the weight on the best path through the
     output determinized FSA that will include this DetState.  It will determine
     the order of expansion of DetStates and also whether the states are
     expanded at all (if the pruning beam `beam` is finite).
     forward_backward_weight is the sum of the forward weight of the base state,
     plus (the greatest over the DetStateElements, of its `weight` element,
     plus the backward weight in the input FSA of the state that corresponds
     to it).
