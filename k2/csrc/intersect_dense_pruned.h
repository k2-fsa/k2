/**
     Pruned intersection (a.k.a. composition) that corresponds to decoding for
     speech recognition-type tasks for online fashion.
       @param [in] a_fsas  The decoding graphs, one per sequence.  E.g. might
                           just be a linear sequence of phones, or might be
                           something more complicated.  Must have either the
                           same Dim0() as b_fsas, or Dim0()==1 in which
                           case the graph is shared.
       @param [in] num_seqs  The number of sequences to do intersection at a
                             time, i.e. batch size. The input DenseFsaVec in
                             `Intersect` function MUST have `Dim0()` equals to
                             this.
       @param [in] search_beam    "Default" search/decoding beam.  The actual
                           beam is dynamic and also depends on max_active and
                           min_active.
       @param [in] output_beam    Beam for pruning the output FSA, will
                                  typically be smaller than search_beam.
       @param [in] min_active  Minimum number of FSA states that are allowed to
                           be active on any given frame for any given
                           intersection/composition task. This is advisory,
                           in that it will try not to have fewer than this
                           number active.
       @param [in] max_active  Maximum number of FSA states that are allowed to
                           be active on any given frame for any given
                           intersection/composition task. This is advisory,
                           in that it will try not to exceed that but may not
                           always succeed.  This determines the hash size.
