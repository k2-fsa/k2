/*
  This version of `IsRandEquivalent` will be used to check the equivalence
  between the input FSA `a` and the output FSA `b` of `RmEpsilonPrunedLogSum`.
  We need this version because `RmEpsilonPrunedLogSum` does pruning on the input
  FSA instead of on the output FSA (compared with other algorithm such as
  determinization), thus it will goes against the symmetric assumption of
  IsRandEquivalent as `a` may always has greater weights than `b` for any symbol
  sequence.

  Specifically, we implement the algorithm as below:
    1. any path in `b` that is within `beam` of the total weight of `b` should
       be present in `a` with a weight that is not greater than its weight in
       `b`;
    2. any path (without epsilon arcs) in `a` that is within `beam` of the total
       weight of `a` should be present in `b` with a weight that is not less
       than its weight in `a`.

  The function returns true if `a` is stochastically equivalent to `b` by
  randomly generating `npath` paths from one of them and then checking if each
  path exists in the other one and if the relationship of two weights satisfies
  above rules.

  @param [in]  a          The FSA before epsion-removal
                          (input FSA of `RmEpsilonPrunedLogSum`)
  @param [in]  a_weights  Arc weights of `a`
  @param [in]  b          The FSA after epsion-removal
                          (output FSA of `RmEpsilonPrunedLogSum`)
  @param [in]  b_weights  Arc weights of `b`
  @param [in]  beam       beam > 0 that affects pruning; the algorithm
                          will only check paths within `beam` of the
                          total weight of `a` or `b`. The value of `beam`
                          should also be not greater than the `beam` value
                          used in `RmEpsilonPrunedLogSum`.
  @param [in]  top_sorted The user may set this to true if both `a` and `b` are
                          topologically sorted; this makes this function faster.
