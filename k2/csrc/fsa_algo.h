  the final state.

                              acyclic, the output fsa is topologically sorted.

      Returns true on success (i.e. the output will be topsorted).
      The only failure condition is when the input had cycles that were not self
  loops.

  Removes states that are not accessible (from the start state) or are not
  co-accessible (i.e. that cannot reach the final state), and ensures that
  if the FSA admits a topological sorting (i.e. it contains no cycles except
  self-loops), the version that is output is topologically sorted.  This
  is not a stable sort, i.e. states may be renumbered even for top-sorted
  input.

     @param [in] a    Input FSA
     @param [out] b   Output FSA, that will be trim / connected (there are
                      two terminologies).

     @param [out] arc_map   If non-NULL, this function will
                            output a map from the arc-index in `b` to
                            the corresponding arc-index in `a`.

     @return   The return status indicates whether topological sorting
        was successful; if true, the result is top-sorted.  The only situation
        it might return false is when the input had cycles that were not self
        loops; such FSAs do not admit a topological sorting.

        nonempty.

  Notes:
    - If `a` admitted a topological sorting, b will be topologically
      sorted. If `a` is not topologically sorted but is acyclic, b will
      also be topologically sorted. TODO(Dan): maybe just leave in the
      same order as a?? (Current implementation may **renumber** the state)
    - If `a` was deterministic, `b` will be deterministic; same for
      epsilon free, obviously.
    - `b` will be arc-sorted (arcs sorted by label). TODO(fangjun): this
       has not be implemented.
    - `b` will (obviously) be connected
