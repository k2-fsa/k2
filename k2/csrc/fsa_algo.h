  Notes:
    - If `a` admitted a topological sorting, b will be topologically
      sorted.  TODO(Dan): maybe just leave in the same order as a??
    - If `a` was deterministic, `b` will be deterministic; same for
      epsilon free, obviously.
    - `b` will be arc-sorted (arcs sorted by label)
    - `b` will (obviously) be connected

/**
   Output an Fsa that is equivalent to the input (in the tropical semiring,
   which here means taking the max of the weights along paths) but which has no
   epsilons.  The input needs to have associated weights, because they will be
   used to choose the best among alternative epsilon paths between states.

    @param [in]  a  The input, with weights and forward-backward weights
                    as required by this computation.  For now we assume
                    that `a` is topologically sorted, as required by
                    the current constructor of WfsaWithFbWeights.
    @param [in] beam  beam > 0 that affects pruning; this algorithm will
                    keep paths that are within `beam` of the best path.
                    Just make this very large if you don't want pruning.
    @param [out] b  The output FSA; will be epsilon-free, and the states
                    will be in the same order that they were in in `a`.
    @param [out] arc_map  If non-NULL: for each arc in `b`, a list of
                    the arc-indexes in `a`, in order, that contributed
                    to that arc (e.g. its cost would be a sum of their costs).

   Notes on algorithm (please rework all this when it's complete, i.e. just
   make sure the code is clear and remove this).

     The states in the output FSA will correspond to the subset of states in the
     input FSA which are within `beam` of the best path and which have at least
     one non-epsilon arc entering them, plus the start state.  (Note: this
     automatically includes the final state, assuming `a` has at least one
     successful path; if it does not, the output will be empty).

     If we ever need the associated state map from calling code, we'll add an
     extra output argument to this function.

     The basic algorithm is to (1) identify the kept states, (2) from each kept
     input-state ki, we'll iterate over all states that are reachable via zero
     or more epsilons from this state and process the non-epsilon outgoing arcs
     from those states, which will become the arcs in the output.  We'll also
     store a back-pointer array that will allow us to figure out the best path
     back to ki, in order to produce the output `arc_map`.    Assume we have
     arrays

     local_forward_weights (float) and local_backpointers (int) indexed by
     state-id, and that the local_forward_weights are initialized with
     -infinity's each time we process a new ki. (we have to figure out how to do
     this efficiently).


      Processing input-state ki:
         local_forward_state_weights[ki] = forward_state_weights[ki] // from WfsaWithFbWeights.
                                                                     // Caution: we should probably use

         local_backpointers[ki] = -1  // will terminate a sequence..
         queue.push_back(ki)
         while (!queue.empty()) {
            ji = queue.front()  // we have to be a bit careful about order here, to make sure

                                // FSA was top-sorted at the start, which we assume, we could perhaps
                                // process them in numerical order, e.g. using a heap.

                    add an arc to the output FSA, and create the appropriate
                    arc_map entry by following backpointers (hopefully you can
                    figure out the details).  Note: the output FSA's weights can be
                    computed later on, by calling code, using the info in arc_map.
