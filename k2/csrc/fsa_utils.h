/*
  Create an Fsa from string.

  The string `s` consists of lines. Every line, except the line for
  the final state, has one of the following two formats:

  (1)
      src_state dest_state label cost
  which means the string represents an acceptor.

  (2)
      src_state dest_state label aux_label cost
  which indicates the string is a transducer.

  The line for the final state has the following format when `openfst` is false:

      final_state

  This is because final state in k2 does not bear a cost. Instead, we put the
  cost on the arc that connects to the final state, and set its label to -1.
  When `openfst` is true, we expect the more generic OpenFst sytle final state
  format :

      final_state cost

  And we allow more than one final states when `openfst` is true.

  Note that fields are separated by spaces and tabs. There can exist
  multiple tabs and spaces.

  CAUTION: The first column has to be in non-decreasing order.

  @param [in]   s   The input string. See the above description for its format.
  @param [in]   openfst
                    If true, the string form has the weights as costs, not
                    scores, so we negate them as we read. We will also allow
                    multiple final states with weights associated with them.
  @param [out]  aux_labels
                    If NULL, we treat the input as an acceptor; otherwise we
                    treat the input as an transducer, and store the
                    corresponding output labels to it. It is allocated inside
                    the function and will contain aux_label of each arc.
                    Note that it is allocated on CPU if needed.

  @return It returns an Fsa on CPU.

/* Convert an FSA to a string.

   If the FSA is an acceptor, i.e., aux_labels == nullptr,  every arc
   is converted to a line with the following form:

      src_state dest_state label score

   If the FSA is a transducer, i.e., aux_labels != nullptr, every arc
   is converted to a lien with the following form:

      src_state dest_state label aux_label score

   The last line of the resulting string contains:

      final_state

   NOTE: Fields are separated by only ONE space.
   There are no leading or trailing spaces.

   NOTE: If `openfst` is true, scores are first negated and then printed.

                    must be non-decreasing.
                    Caution: the function will abort with an error if the
                    dest_state of an arc in the original Fsa is not kept in
                    the output Fsa (i.e.  the dest_state is not in `order`).
                    Noted if the number of states in `order` for an input Fsa
                    is not zero, then it must be at least 2 (and those states
                    must contain the start state and final state in the input
