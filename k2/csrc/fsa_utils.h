  Create an Fsa from string.

  The string `s` consists of lines. Every line, except the line for
  the final state, has one of the following two formats:

  (1)
      src_state dest_state label cost
  which means the string represents an acceptor.

  (2)
      src_state dest_state label aux_label cost
  which indicates the string is a transducer.

  The line for the final state has the following format:

      final_state

  Note that fields are separated by spaces and tabs. There can exist
  multiple tabs and spaces.

  CAUTION: The line for the final state contains NO cost.
  When an arc's dest state is the final state, we put the cost
  on the arc and set its label to -1.

  CAUTION: We assume that `final_state` has the largest state number.

  CAUTION: The first column has to be in non-decreasing order.

  @param [in]   s   The input string. See the above description for its format.
  @param [in]   negate_scores
                    If true, the string form has the weights as costs,
                    not scores, so we negate as we read.
  @param [out]  aux_labels
                    Used only when it is a transducer. It is allocated
                    inside the function and will contain aux_label of each arc.
                    Note that it is allocated on CPU if needed.

  @return It returns an Fsa on CPU.

/* Convert an FSA to a string.

   If the FSA is an acceptor, i.e., aux_labels == nullptr,  every arc
   is converted to a line with the following form:

      src_state dest_state label score

   If the FSA is a transducer, i.e., aux_labels != nullptr, every arc
   is converted to a lien with the following form:

      src_state dest_state label aux_label score

   The last line of the resulting string contains:

      final_state

   NOTE: Fields are separated by only ONE space.
   There are no leading or trailing spaces.

   NOTE: If `negate_scores` is true, scores are first negated and then printed.

   CAUTION: We support only FSAs on the CPU.

   @param [in]  fsa   The input FSA, which MUST be on CPU.
   @param [in]  negate_scores
                      If true, the scores will first be negated and
                      then printed.
   @param in]   aux_labels
                      If not NULL, the FSA is a transducer and it contains the
                      aux labels of each arc.
