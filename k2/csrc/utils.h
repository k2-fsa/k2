  sizes concept

  A vector of sizes is a vector of non-negative integers, like [ 5 4 0 1 3 ].
  This just establishes a naming convention.  In most cases the 'sizes' will
  be the lengths of sub-lists in a list of lists.

  Relation to other concepts:
   A vector of sizes can be seen as the difference of successive elements of
  a vector of row_splits, i.e. sizes[i] = row_splits[i+1] - row_splits[i].
*/

/*
  row_splits concept / row-splits concept
  (Note, this has been named for compatibility with TensorFlow's RaggedTensor).

  A row_splits vector is a vector of the form, say, [ 0 5 9 9 10 13 ].
  i.e. it starts with 0 and is non-decreasing.  It will often be encountered
  as the exclusive-sum of a vector of 'sizes' (see 'sizes concept' above),
  with a size one greater than that of the corresponding 'sizes'.  It
  will represent the positions in a single linearized list, of where we
  put the elements of a list of sub-lists.  So in the example above,
  sub-list 0 occupies positions 0,1,2,3,4, sub-list 1 occupies positions
  5,6,7,8, and so on.  Caution: the number of elements of the row_splits vector
  equals the number of sub-lists PLUS ONE.

  Relation to other concepts:
    See 'row_ids concept' where its relation to 'row_splits' is described.
    If row_splits = [ 0 2 3 5 ], the corresponding 'row_ids' is:
    row_ids = [ 0 0 1 2 2 ].
*/

/*
  row_ids concept / row-ids concept
  (Note, this has been named for compatibility with TensorFlow's RaggedTensor).

  A vector of row_ids is a vector of the form
    [ 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 ]
  or in general any nonnegative, non-decreasing list of integers.  Each
  value represents the index of the sub-list to which that position belongs; for
  instance, if we had a list-of-lists like [ a b c ] [ d e ] [ f g h ], the
  above vector of row_ids would describe its structure.

  Relation to other concepts:
    A vector of row_ids can arise as the cumulative sum of a vector of tails.
    A vector of row_ids and a vector of row_splits represent the same
  information in different ways, satisfying row_splits[row_ids[i]] <= i <
  row_splits[row_ids[i] + 1] and row_splits[row_splits.size() - 1] ==
  row_ids.size().

*/

/*
  tails concept

  A vector of tails is a vector containing zeros and ones; each '1' represents
  the last element of a sub-list.  For example [ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 ] to represent
  a list of sub-lists like [ x x ] [ y y y y ] [ z ].  The last element will
  always be 1.

  Relation to other concepts:
    The exclusive cumulative sum of a vector of tails is a vector of row_ids.
  E.g. the above example, with exclusive cumulative sum, is:
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 ].

/*

  Index naming scheme

  In a ragged tensor with n axes (say, 3) the actual elements will be written
  in a linear array we'll have various levels of indexes that allow us to
  look up an element given the hierarchical indexes and vice versa.  A 3-d
  ragged tensor will have RowIds1(), RowSplits1(), RowIds2(), RowSplits2(),
  and the actual elements.  We have a naming scheme that expresses what
  information is packed into a single integer.

  Some entry-level facts about the naming scheme are:

     - The hierarchical indexes into the tensor (3 of them for a tensor with 3
       axes), we call idx0, idx1 and idx2
     - The linear index into the elements, we call idx012 because it includes
       all 3 values.
     - The RowSplits1() would map from an idx0 to an idx0x.  The x here
       takes the place of a 1 and that replacement means "actually the index
       here is definitely zero".  Any specific idx0x that we have will be
       for a particular idx0.

   For more details, it's best to use an example.


     # below is pseudocode
     RaggedTensor3 t = [ [ [ 1 2 ] [ 5 ] ] [ [ 7 8 9 ] ] ]

     # which will give us:
     t.row_splits1 == [ 0 2 3 ]    # indexed by idx0, elements are idx0x
     t.row_ids1 == [ 0 0 1 ]       # indexed by idx01, elements are idx0
     t.row_splits2 == [ 0 2 3 6 ]  # indexed by idx01, elements are idx01x
     t.row_ids2 == [ 0 0 1 2 2 2 ] # indexed by idx012, elements are idx01
     t.values == [ 1 2 5 7 8 9 ]   # indexed by idx012, elements are whatever
                                   # values we're storing.

     Sometimes we'll want to know the number of elements in sub-lists, and we
     have a notation for the computations involved in that.  Suppose we want to
     know the number of elements in T[0].  We'll compute:
       int32_t idx0 = 0,
           idx0x = t.row_splits1[idx0],
           idx0x_next = t.row_splits1[idx0 + 1],
           idx0xx = t.row_splits2[idx0x],
           idx0xx_next = t.row_splits2[idx0x_next],
           size_0xx = idx0xx_next - idx0xx
     (The _next suffix is used when we're querying the most specific known index
     plus one, in this case index 0 but for instance, idx01x_next would mean
     that we were querying idx01x after incrementing the index on axis 1.)

     We also might sometimes want to know an offset of an element within the
     part of the array that starts with a particular prefix of that index.
     E.g. suppose we want the offset of element t[ idx0, idx1, idx2 ]
     relative to the start of the sub-array t[idx0].  We'd do this as
     follows:
        int32_t idx0, idx1, idx2;  # provided
        int32_t idx0x = t.row_splits1[idx0],
            idx01 = idx0x + idx1,
            idx01x = t.row_splits2[idx1],
            idx012 = idx01x + idx2,
            idx0xx = t.row_splits2[idx0x],
            idx12 = idx012 - idx0xx;
     In the last line above, when we subtract idx012 - idx0xx we lose the
     leading "0" because the zeroth index was the same in the two things being
     subtracted.  Note: in an expression like idx0xx_next - idx0xx we don't get
     idxxxx because index zero is *different*.  However, the result of
     idx01x_next - idx01x would be written idx1x because index zero would be
     the same.

     The advantage of this naming scheme is that the 'type' that operations give
     is intuitively obvious and any mismatches will tend to be obvious in
     an individual line of code once you have understood the naming scheme
     and its rules.

   Perform exclusive cumulative sum: dest[i] = 0 + src[0] + src[1] + ...
  src[i-1] for 0 <= i < n.  Note: although the input for 0 <= i < n-1 is all
  that affects the output, the last element src[n-1] may still be accessed in
  the CUDA kernel so you should make sure it was allocated as part of the array
  being summed even if the value was not set.

      @param [in] c     Context object, specifies CPU or GPU
      @param [in] n     Number of elements in the input and output arrays
                        (although only items up to n-1 in the input array will

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
     - If size of t is small enough that it makes sense to do it in one
  cooperative thread group (and maybe a small internal loop if needed), do that.
     - Otherwise, do it with 3 consecutive kernels:
       consider the input array to be made up of blocks of size BLOCK_SIZE,
  equal to some power of 2.  First, invoke the same kernel we used above to
  write the this-block-only partial sum for each block (note: only the 1st
  kernel should write the initial 0, to avoid race conditions), so e.g. if the
       input was [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] and BLOCK_SIZE = 2, the temporary array would be
       [ 0 1 3 3 7 5 ].  Then use a single thread block to inclusive-sum the
       values at multiples of BLOCK_SIZE, so the array looks like [ 0 1 3 3 10 5
  ] (note: only the 7 changed, to 10 here).  Then use a single simple kernel to,
  for each index i that is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, add to it the value at
  the most recent multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, so the array would look like [ 0 1 3 6
  10 15 ].

                   num_jobs == 2*num_tasks.  See documentation of its members

   The way we allocate the jobs (2*num_tasks of them) to input tasks is:
   the first `num_tasks` jobs are assigned one-to-one to input tasks
   (this ensures that each input task gets at least one job).  We
   allocate the other half of the jobs by placing regularly spaced
   integers j on the interval [0,row_splits[num_tasks]] and seeing which of the
   input tasks the 'fall into', in the sense row_splits[i] <= j <
   row_splits[i+1].  The result is of course somewhat random, but this strategy
   ensures that the work per job (i.e. the difference in row-splits
   divided by the num-jobs for that input-task ) can never be >= double
   the average `work per job`.

   Note: we imagine (hope?) that in general row_splits won't be that large,
   maybe <= 1024, and we'll care more about latency than throughput.  The idea
   is that this is used to determine allocate threads for a larger number of
   jobs in a separate kernel.
