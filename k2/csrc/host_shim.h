/*
  Create an FsaVec (vector of FSAs) from a Tensor.  Please see FsaFromTensor for
  how this works for a single FSA.  The reason we can do the same with multiple
  FSAs is that we can use the discontinuities in `src_state` (i.e. where the
  values decrease) to spot where one FSA starts and the next begins.  However
  this only works if all the FSAs were nonempty, i.e. had at least one state.
  This function will die with an assertion failure if any of the provided
  FSAs were empty, so the user should check that beforehand.

  Please see FsaFromTensor() for documentation on what makes the individual
  FSAs valid; however, please note that the FSA with no states (empty FSA)
  cannot appear here, as there is no way to indicate it in a flat
  series of arcs.

    @param [in] t   Source tensor.  Must have dtype == kInt32Dtype and be of
                    shape (N > 0) by 4.  Caution: the returned FSA will share
                    memory with this tensor, so don't modify it afterward!
    @param [out] error   Error flag.  On success this function will write
                        'false' here; on error, it will print an error
                        message to the standard error and write 'true' here.
    @return         The resulting FsaVec (vector of FSAs) will be returned;
                    this is a Ragged<Arc> with 3 axes.


  This only works of `fsa` was on the CPU.  Note: the k2host::Fsa
  refers to memory inside `fsa`, so making a copy doesn't work.
  Be careful with the returned k2host::Fsa as it does not own its
  own memory!
