  See declaration of RowSplitsToRowIds() in utils.h.  These are implementation
  notes.

    Suppose the range we need to fill with a
    particular number (say, x) is from 1010 to 10000 inclusive (binary) The
    first kernel writes x to positions 1010, 1100, 10000; the significance of
    that sequence is we keep adding the smallest number we can add to get
    another zero at the end of the binary representation, until we exceed the
    range we're supposed to fill.  The second kernel: for a given index into x
    that is must fill (say, 1111), it asks "is the index currently here already
    the right one?", which it can test using the function is_valid_index()
    below; if it's not already correct, it searches in a sequence of positions:
    1110, 1100, 1000, 0000, like our sequence above but going downwards, again
    getting more zeros at the end of the binary representation, until it finds
    the correct value in the array at the searched position; then it copies the
    discovered value the original position requested (here, 1111).


    First kernel pseudocode: for each index 'i' into 't', it does:
      for (int32_t n=0, j = t[i]; j < t[i+1]; n++) {
         x[j] = i;
         if (j & (1<<n))  j += (1 << n);
      }
    Second kernel pseudocode: for each element of x, it searches for the right
  index.  Suppose we're given num_indexes == length(n) == length(t) - 1.  Define
  is_valid_index as follows:
       // returns true if j is the value that we should be putting at position
  'i' in x:
       // that is, if t[j] <= i < t[j+1].
       bool is_valid_index(i, j) {
          return (j >= 0 && j < num_indexes && t[j] <= i && i < t[j+1]);
       }
       // We suppose we are given i (the position into x that we're responsible
  for
       // setting:
       orig_i = i;
       for (int32_t n=0; !is_valid_index(i, x[i]); n++) {
         if (i & (1<<n))  i -= (1 << n);
       }
       x[orig_i] = x[i];

/*
  This is a quite simple implementation of GetTaskRedirect... I had a more
  complicated one above that had better O(N) performance for hard cases, but
  this one will handle more normal/smaller cases better, plus is easier to
  debug.  The basic idea is to throw lots of threads at it,
  i.e. threads_per_task should be, say, twice larger than the average / expected
  number of jobs per task, so that if a task has lots of jobs it doesn't have to
  loop too many times.
