  NOTE: let's leave this for later, this won't be needed initially.

  Used to run a task "in the background" (with a thread pool), for parallelism.
  This should generally be used together with the GetChild() of the context
  object so that in case we're using a GPU the GPU stream doesn't cause the
  tasks to be serialized.

  General usage would be:
     ContextPtr c;  // passed in

  Class ParallelRunner allows you to invoke CUDA kernels in parallel.
  It works for CUDA and CPU, but for CPU it currently just executes things
  sequentially.  It works by creating a separate stream each time you
  call NewStream(),, and using CUDA events to ensure correct ordering of kernels
  with respect to the CUDA stream in the supplied context.

  Note: it's important to destroy this at the right time.  The usage pattern
  should be:

   (a) Do whatever you were doing before (i.e. previous tasks in the
       stream of ContextPtr c).
   (b) Create this object
   (c) For each task to be done in parallel:
        - Call NewStream() on this object, and then either pass the stream to
          Eval() directly or do `With w(pr.Stream());` and call any function
          while that's in scope (it automagically swaps the stream that
          the Context returns for the newly created one).
          [Note: if you give the tasks the same stream they'll execute
          sequentially so there is no point in calling NewStream() just once].
   (d) Destroy this object by letting it go out of scope
   (e) Do whatever you need to do after the parallel jobs (i.e. following
