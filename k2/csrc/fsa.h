  This FSA has T + 2 states, with state 0 the start state and state T + 2
  the final state.  (Caution: if we formulated our FSAs more normally we
  would have T + 1 states, but because we represent final-probs via an
  arc with symbol kFinalSymbol on it to the last state, we need one
  more state).   For 0 <= t < T, we have an arc with symbol n on it for
