  struct Fsa is an unweighted finite-state acceptor (FSA) and is at the core of

  a final-state is represented by an arc with label == kEpsilon to final_state.

  The start-state is always numbered zero and the final-state is always the
  last-numbered state.  However, we represent the empty FSA (the one that
  accepts no strings) by having no states at all, so `arcs` would be empty.

  DenseFsa represents an FSA stored as a matrix, representing something
  like CTC output from a neural net.  We view `weights` as a T by N
  matrix, where N is the number of symbols (including blank/zero).

  Physically, we would access weights[t,n] as weights[t * t_stride + n].

  This FSA has T + 2 states, with state 0 the start state and state T + 2
  the final state.  (Caution: if we formulated our FSAs more normally we
  would have T + 1 states, but because we represent final-probs via an
  arc with symbol kFinalSymbol on it to the last state, we need one
  more state).   For 0 <= t < T, we have an arc with symbol n on it for
  each 0 <= n < N, from state t to state t+1, with weight equal to
  weights[t,n].
