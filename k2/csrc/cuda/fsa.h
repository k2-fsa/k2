/*
  Vector of FSAs that actually will come from neural net log-softmax outputs (or similar).

  Conceptually this is a 3-dimensional tensor of log-probs with the second
  dimension ragged, i.e.  the shape would be [ num_fsas, None, num_symbols+1 ],
  e.g. if this were a TF ragged tensor.  The indexing would be
  [fsa_idx,t,symbol+1], where the "+1" after the symbol is so that we have
  somewhere to put the output for symbol == -1 (remember, -1 is kFinalSymbol,
  used on the last frame).

  Also, if a particular FSA has T frames of neural net output, we actually
  have T+1 potential indexes, 0 through T, so there is space for the terminating
  final-symbol on frame T.  (On the last frame, the final symbol has
  logprob=0, the others have logprob=-inf).
