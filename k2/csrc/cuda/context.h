   class Context is the main surface of interaction with external
   tensor libraries like PyTorch; it allows us to use their notions
   of device and of memory allocation.
   (in the case of PyTorch it would probably contain a Device and an Allocator).

   We will sub-class this in several ways: with versions that wrap external
   toolkits like PyTorch, and also a "native" version that's mostly for
   testing purposes.

   This object should be allocated with std::shared_ptr, as that's how we store

    std::shared_ptr to this object instead.

    The reason this is necessary is that originally when we get this Context
    we'll get it from some kind of tensor from an external toolkit, and this
    might be part of an Array that points to memory held by a Tensor that came
    from that toolkit.  In that case the right way to free the memory inside
    Deallocate() would be to destroy our locally held copy of that Tensor, and
    the Context will know this.  When we call Duplicate() on this type of
    Context, it will give us a "fresh" Context that will allocate and deallocate
    in the normal way.
