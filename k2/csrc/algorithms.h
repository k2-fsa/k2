  /*
     This constructor will allocate memory for `keep_` array with size
     `num_old_elems`. User then can call `Keep` to get `keep_` and set values in
     it (1 if kept, 0 if not kept), then call `New2Old` to map new indexes to
     old indexes or `Old2New` to map old indexes to new indexes.

        @param [in] c The context this Renumbering object will work on.
        @param [in] num_old_elems  The number of old indexes (i.e.
                      keep_.Dim() or NumOldElems()).
        @param [in] init_keep_with_zero  If true, we will initialize `keep_`
                      with 0 when creating; if false, we just allocate memory
                      and don't initialize it. CAUTION: usually user should
                      leave it as false (the default value), as coalesced
                      writing to an array (i.e `keep_`) would be much more
                      efficient than writing individual 1's, especially
                      considering that we have used another kernel to
                      initialize the `keep` array with 0 if
                      `init_keep_with_zero` = true. We suggest users should
                      set it with true only when it's hard for them to set
                      both 1s (kept indexes) and 0s (not kept indexes) in one
                      kernel.
