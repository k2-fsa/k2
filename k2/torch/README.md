## Introduction

This directory contains code for deployment using PyTorch C++ APIs,
without Python dependencies.

If CUDA is enabled, you have to use PyTorch >= 1.8.0 to compile it.
(You can see a warning saying this when running `cmake`)

We suggest that you use <https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa>
if you want to use k2's C++ APIs for speech recognition.
